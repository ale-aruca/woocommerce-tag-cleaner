Clean conflicting product tags with flexible selection and real-time progress tracking.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Tag Cleaner helps you clean up conflicting product tags by allowing you to select which tags to keep and which to remove from products. Perfect for cleaning up messy tag structures in large WooCommerce stores.

= Key Features =

* **Flexible Tag Selection**: Choose any combination of tags to keep and remove
* **Real-time Conflict Detection**: See live statistics of conflicting products
* **Safe Preview**: Preview which products will be affected before making changes
* **Batch Processing**: Handles large inventories without timeouts
* **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with detailed logging
* **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if individual products fail

= How It Works =

1. Select tags you want to **keep** on products
2. Select tags you want to **remove** from products
3. The plugin finds products that have tags from both groups
